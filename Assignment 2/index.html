			<p>I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. 
			But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, 
			and they've become quite a hit.</p>
			<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, 
			stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on 
			all things Halloween.</p>
	
			<h3>My guarantee</h3>
			<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it 
			for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
